A [new Reuters research report][link] co-conducted with Oxford University shows that more Indians than ever (68% of those polled in the study) are receiving the bulk of their English-language online news on their mobile phones rather than computers or other devices. Social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp have shown to be the biggest medium for accessing news, rather than directly going to the news sourceâ€™s website.
