Seeking to recover his companyâ€™s beleaguered reputation, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg [released a blog post][link] in early March in which he [committed the company to the use of end-to-end encryption for its Messenger application.][link2] This may or may not assuage the fears of many online privacy advocates who voiced grave concerns earlier this year when Facebook announced that would merge the operating systems of Messenger with those of WhatsApp, a secure messaging service it had acquired some years back. The fear was that with end-to-end encryption removed during the merger, governments in undemocratic nations -where many WhatsApp users operate- would be able to track the messages of users.
