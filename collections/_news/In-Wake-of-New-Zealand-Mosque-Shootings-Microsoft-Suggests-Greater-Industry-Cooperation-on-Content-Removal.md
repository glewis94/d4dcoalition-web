The use of social media and video-streaming platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, etc. have become way for depraved individuals to spread images and footage of mass violence like that of the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings earlier this month. In response to this, the president of Microsoft [has suggested][link] creating a “joint virtual command center” to respond to postings of such heinous acts. In a blog post, the industry leader has suggested that certain emergency situations like the New Zealand massacre be deemed “major events” that would warrant all companies providing social media or video-streaming services to work together on a temporary flag and remove offensive content regarding the event.
